# RAINFALL PREDICTION
Hi every one here I doing a machine learning project for Rainfall Prediction.Here I am going to introduce new concept that is the MLFlow

## Project Structure

- [`Rainfall_Predicion/app.py`](Rainfall_Predicion/app.py ): The main Flask application file that handles routing and prediction logic.
- `EDA_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `EDA_Model_v1.ipynb`: Another version of the exploratory data analysis and model development notebook.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web application.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files like CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Pandas
- mlflow
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RudyTchamba/RepoDatascience-MachineLearning/tree/main/Rainfall_Predicion
cd Rainfall_Prediction
```
2. Run the Flask application:
```
python app.py
```
After the steps above the application will be available on the ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/```
