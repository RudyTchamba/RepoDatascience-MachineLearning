# RAINFALL PREDICTION
**Hi every one here I doing a machine learning project for Rainfall Prediction.Here I am going to introduce new concept that is the MLFlow**


- [`Rainfall_Predicion/app.py`](Rainfall_Predicion/app.py ): The main Flask application file that handles routing and prediction logic.
- `EDA_Model_v1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook forf the exploratory data analysis and model development notebook.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web application.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files like CSS and JavaScript.
